# YugabyteDB workload generator

This repository emulates various workloads against YugabyteDB. YugabyteDB is a multi-model database that supports:
* YSQL (Distributed SQL API with joins. Compatible with PostgreSQL)
* YCQL (Flexible-schema API with indexes, transactions and the JSONB data type. Roots in Cassandra QL)
* YEDIS (Transactional KV API with elasticity and persistence. Compatible with Redis)

The workloads here have drivers compatible with the above and emulate a number of real-work scenarios.

## Running the generator

Download yb-sample-apps JAR
```
$ wget https://github.com/yogendra/yb-sample-apps/releases/download/latest/yb-sample-apps.jar
```

Download latest snapshot JAR
```
$ wget https://github.com/yogendra/yb-sample-apps/releases/download/latest-snapshot/yb-sample-apps.jar
```

For help, simply run the following:

```
$ java -jar yb-sample-apps.jar --help
```
You should see the set of workloads available in the app.

To get details on running any app, just pass the app name as a parameter to the `--help` flag:
```
$ java -jar yb-sample-apps.jar --help CassandraKeyValue
1 [main] INFO com.yugabyte.sample.Main  - Starting sample app...
Usage and options for workload CassandraKeyValue in YugabyteDB Sample Apps.

 - CassandraKeyValue :
   -----------------
		Sample key-value app built on Cassandra with concurrent reader and writer threads.
		 Each of these threads operates on a single key-value pair. The number of readers
		 and writers, the value size, the number of inserts vs updates are configurable.
                 By default number of reads and writes operations are configured to 1500000 and 2000000 respectively.
		 User can run read/write(both) operations indefinitely by passing -1 to --num_reads or --num_writes or both

		Usage:
			java -jar yb-sample-apps.jar \
			--workload CassandraKeyValue \
			--nodes 127.0.0.1:9042

		Other options (with default values):
			[ --num_unique_keys 2000000 ]
			[ --num_reads 1500000 ]
			[ --num_writes 2000000 ]
			[ --value_size 0 ]
			[ --num_threads_read 24 ]
			[ --num_threads_write 2 ]
			[ --table_ttl_seconds -1 ]
```

## Building the generator

You need the following to build:
* Java 1.8 or above
* Maven version 3.3.9 or above

To build, simply run the following:
```
$ mvn -DskipTests -DskipDockerBuild package
```

You can find the executable one-jar at the following location:
```
$ ls target/yb-sample-apps.jar
target/yb-sample-apps.jar
```

To docker image with the package, simply run the following:
```
$ mvn package
```
